# ChatGPT Cleaner

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

### üß© Introduction  
**ChatGPT Cleaner** is a simple desktop application designed to clean `.md` files exported from ChatGPT conversations. It removes all user messages while preserving only the AI-generated responses.

### ‚ùì Purpose & Problem Statement  
When exporting conversations from ChatGPT or tools like `chat2markdown.py`, the output includes both user and assistant messages. For users who wish to keep only the assistant's responses (for documentation, publishing, or archiving), manually editing these logs can be tedious.

### üéØ Value Proposition  
This tool streamlines that process by automatically:
- Removing user messages.
- Preserving only ChatGPT or Assistant messages.
- Providing a visual preview and save feature.
- Supporting batch processing of multiple `.md` files at once.
